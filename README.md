# 42-minishell

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell, like an own little bash.
It is the first group project in the 42 core curriculum.

## Project specifications

For the project we were allowed to use GNU's readline library which handles the terminal interaction (history & input reading).
For everything else the subject allows only to use a few low-level functions and a few POSIX system calls.

<b>Allowed functions:</b>
```readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line,rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history, printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read,close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit, getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir, strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl, getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs```

## Features

### Basics:
- History of previous entered commands
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable, using a relative or an absolute path)
- ```â€™``` (single quote - prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence)
- ```"``` (double quote - prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence except for $)
- Environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) expand to their values
- ```$?``` expands to the last exit status
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ behave like in bash

### Builtins:
- ```echo``` with option -n
- ```cd``` (relative or absolute path, ```-``` for OLDPWD, without arg for HOME)
- ```pwd``` without options
- ```export``` without options
- ```unset``` without options
- ```env``` without options
- ```exit [n]``` without options

### Redirections:

- ```[n]``` (optional) specifies the file descriptor, if not specified it is stdout or stdin

<b>Redirecting Input</b>
```
[n]< file
```

<b>Here Documents</b>
```
[n]<< limiter
```

<b>Redirecting Output</b>
```
[n]< file
```

<b>Appending Redirected Output</b>
```
[n]>> file
```

- ```&&``` and ```||``` with parenthesis for priorities
- Wildcards * in the current working directory

## How to use

The current version of minishell is developed and tested on macOS, but it should work on all UNIX/LINUX based systems as well.

<b>Requirements:</b>
- GCC / CLANG Compiler
- GNU Make
- GNU Readline library

1. Download/Clone this repo
```
git clone <repo-url> minishell
```
```
cd minishell && make release
```
```
./minishell
```

## Dependencies
### Install readline with [brew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew install readline
```

```
brew link --force readline
```

Add the path to the lib

Replace ~/.zshrc with ~/.bashrc if you use bash instead of zsh
```
echo 'export 'C_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```
echo 'export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Install readline on 42 Macs

Install Brew, <b>only if it is not already installed:</b>

```
rm -rf $HOME/.brew && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew $HOME/.brew && echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.brew/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc && brew update
```

Install Readline library:
```
brew install readline
```

```
brew link --force readline
```

```
echo 'export C_INCLUDE_PATH="$HOME/.brew/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

```
echo 'export LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.brew/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Activate debug mode

Enter minishell and export the DEBUG env:

```
export DEBUG=printer
```

For all next commands you will execute in the minishell you will see the different processing steps from the lexer and parser with syntax highlighting.

## Change the command line prompt
1. Enter the SHELL
```
./minishell
```
2. Export the PS1 env (also works in Bash and other similar shells)
```
export PS1='enter your prompt wish...$ '
```
